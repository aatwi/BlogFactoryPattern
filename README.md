# Factory Pattern: Replacing the Conditional Statement with Lambda Expressions

This project hosts the code of the example mentioned in my blog [Factory Pattern: Replacing the Conditional Statement with Lambda Expressions](http://ahmadatwi.me/2019/04/16/factory-pattern-replacing-the-conditional-statement-with-lambda-expressions/). 

The purpose of the blog post is to explain how I use lambda expressions to replace the Conditional Statements in the Factory Design Pattern.
